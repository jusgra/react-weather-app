# Weather find website;

This project was created from a simple idea, to check current weather and conditions of the cities you wish; 

It was built mainly using React, and it is my first ever project in which I try to show my skills and create some portfolio on my repository that I could show as a Front-End programmer. It is a genuine project I built myself and it was not followed as a tutorial. The concept is very simple, API call and showing the response results.

I used state and effect Hooks in order to show off the results in a dynamic way, also conditional rendering and component tree structure.
