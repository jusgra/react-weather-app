# Weather find website

### This project was created from a simple idea, to check current weather and conditions of the cities you wish

It was built mainly using **React.js**, and it is my first ever project in which I try to show my skills and create some portfolio on my repository that I could show as a Front-End programmer. The concept is very simple, API call and showing the response results. It is a genuine project I built and thought by myself. I designed the layouts and tried to realize the main idea/concept. 

I used **_state_**, **_ref_** and **_effect_** Hooks in order to show results in a dynamic way, also conditional rendering and component tree structure.
