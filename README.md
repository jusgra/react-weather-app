# Weather find website

### This project was created from a simple idea, to check current weather and conditions of the cities you wish

It was built mainly using **React.js**, and it is my first ever project in which I try to show my skills and create some portfolio on my repository that I could show as a Front-End programmer. The concept is very simple, API call and showing the response results. It is a genuine project I built and thought by myself. I designed the layouts and tried to realize the main idea/concept. 

I used **_state_**, **_ref_** and **_effect_** Hooks in order to show results in a dynamic way, also conditional rendering and component tree structure.

<h2>How to run</h2>

1. Make sure you have node.js installed on your computer
2. Download or clone the repo with project files
3. Open terminal inside the downloaded project directory
4. run the "npm i" command to install the required packages
5. run "npm start" command to launch the project on a local server
